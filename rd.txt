Great work, Ritik! You've built a fully functional Unix-style shell in C++, with features like:

Command parsing and execution

Support for pipelines

Built-in commands (cd, pwd, echo, etc.)

Redirection (>, >>, 2>, 2>>)

Command history and tab-completion using GNU Readline

Let‚Äôs break down your shell in a structured, interview-prep friendly way:

üîß 1. Project Structure & Key Libraries
Libraries used:
readline/readline.h, readline/history.h: For command-line editing, history, and autocompletion.

unistd.h, sys/wait.h, fcntl.h: For POSIX system calls like fork, execv, pipe, dup2.

filesystem: For command discovery and directory manipulation.

vector, string, sstream, unordered_set: For managing tokens, input, matches.

üíª 2. User Input Handling
main() loop:
Reads input using readline().

Adds non-empty input to history.

Parses the command:

If it contains |, it's split into parts (pipeline).

Otherwise, it checks for built-in or external commands.

üöÄ 3. Command Execution Logic
üîπ Built-in commands: (Handled by handle_builtin)
echo: Handles standard output and redirection (>, >>, 2>, etc.).

pwd: Uses getcwd.

cd: Resolves ~, absolute paths, and changes directories.

type: Tells whether a command is built-in or an executable.

exit 0: Exits the shell.

history: Displays command history using readline's history_list().

‚úÖ If handle_builtin() returns true, main doesn't call exec.

üîπ External commands: (Handled by execute_command)
Calls fork().

Child:

Parses redirections and sets up dup2.

Calls execv() with resolved path from PATH.

Parent:

Waits using waitpid().

üîó 4. Pipeline Handling
Input like ls | grep txt | wc -l is handled using:

split_pipeline() ‚Üí Splits on unquoted |.

Pipes created using pipe().

Each command runs in a separate process (via fork()).

dup2() is used to connect stdout of one to stdin of the next.

This mimics real shell behavior with chained process I/O.

üß† 5. Command Tokenization & Quoting
split():
Handles:

Quoted strings (', ")

Escaping with \

Ignores spaces unless outside quotes

This ensures echo "hello world" is parsed correctly.

üõ†Ô∏è 6. Command Autocompletion (TAB support)
Uses readline‚Äôs rl_completion_matches() and a custom generator.

Matches:

Shell built-ins

Executables from all directories in $PATH

Handles:

Multiple tab presses

Audible bell

Listing suggestions

Very nice UX addition ‚Äî resembles Bash/Zsh behavior.

üîç 7. Finding Executables
find_executable():
Mimics which:

Parses $PATH.

Searches for executable file using access().

üìÅ 8. Redirection Support
For both built-ins and external commands:
Supports:

> / >>: Redirect stdout (overwrite/append)

2> / 2>>: Redirect stderr

1> / 1>>: Explicit stdout

Uses open() + dup2().

üß™ Possible Interview Questions (with answers)
‚ùì Q1: How does your shell handle pipelines?
I split the input string using |, then create n-1 pipes and fork n child processes. Each child sets up dup2() to redirect stdin/stdout accordingly before calling execv.

‚ùì Q2: How are built-in commands different from external ones?
Built-ins are handled inside the shell process (handle_builtin()), while external commands are executed in a child process using execv.

‚ùì Q3: What happens when the user types a command?
Input is read with readline().

Tokenized with split().

If it's a built-in, handled internally.

Else, find_executable() resolves the path.

A child is forked, and execv() runs the command.

‚ùì Q4: How do you manage history?
I use readline‚Äôs add_history() and history_list() to keep track of commands entered.

‚ùì Q5: How does your shell handle redirection?
I parse for redirection tokens (>, >>, etc.). Then in the child process, I open() the target file and use dup2() to redirect stdout/stderr before executing.

‚ùì Q6: How does autocompletion work?
I use rl_completion_matches() and provide a custom command_generator() that:

Matches from built-in vocabulary.

Scans $PATH for matching executables.

‚úÖ Extra Talking Points (if you want to flex more):
Robust input parsing: Supports quotes, escape chars.

Clean and modular: Functions like split, split_pipeline, handle_builtin, execute_command.

Resilient: Handles missing files, invalid commands gracefully.
